\begin{itemize}
\item I was very pleased with your performance in our first lab yesterday.
\item A lot of sloppy code, but that's because we're starting!
\item Remember, we are learning lots of concepts but also 
learning a new {\bf skill:} {\sc programming}!
\item You have lots of skills already, but you spent a long time
acquiring them.  Like algebra.

Simplify
\[ \frac{x^2-1}{x+1} \]

\item You got these skills by {\bf practice}, not {\bf study}!
\item If you're struggling you need to work on the {\bf fundamentals}.
\begin{itemize}
\item To play better Mozart you need to work on scales.
\item To play better soccer you need to do wind sprints.
\item To remember better you need to quiz yourself.
\end{itemize}
\item To program better you need to practice programming:
\begin{itemize}
\item Do all the exercises in the book
\item There are more free books online: 

\url{https://pythonbooks.org/free-books/}

Do all their exercises!
\item There are interactive tutorials online:

Do all their exercises!
